        <h1>redcap</h1>

<p>redcap is a library for uploading images
to Second Life.  It costs L$10 per image uploaded.
You can save some money during testing by using the
Preview Grid (if available).</p>

<h1>installation</h1>

<p>To install redcap as a gem:
   gem install slothbear-redcap --source <a href="http://gems.github.com">http://gems.github.com</a></p>

<p>If you'd rather grab a couple files and give it a try, download
the following files from <a href="http://github.com/slothbear/redcap/tree/master">http://github.com/slothbear/redcap/tree/master</a>
   bin/redcap
   lib/redcap/uploader.rb</p>

<p>Amend this line in redcap to fit your installation and give it a try.
   require "redcap/uploader"</p>

<h1>usage</h1>

<p>Upload a JPG:
    redcap first_name last_name SL_password your_image.jpg</p>

<p>Upload a PNG to the preview grid:
    redcap -g preview first_name last_name SL_password picture.png</p>

<p>Note you can upload any image format that your installation of ImageMagick
can read.</p>

<h1>release notes</h1>

<p>All images are uploaded into the top level of your Inventory.</p>

<p>Second Life requires the uploaded image dimensions to be powers of 2.  If you'd
like to re-size your image to its original aspect ratio, make use of
Uploader::aspect_ratio.</p>

<h1>Installing ImageMagick and RMagick on Mac OS X</h1>

<pre><code>brew install imagemagick
gem install rmagick
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure your ImageMagick can produce SL-compatible JPEG-2000 files:
   identify -list format | grep JPC
The JPC line should include "rw-" indicating it can write files, like:
    JPC* JPC       rw-   JPEG-2000 Code Stream Syntax</p>

<p>The /tests were developed for a previous release and do not run at this time.</p>
